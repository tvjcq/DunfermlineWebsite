        <h3>
          DUNFERMLINE AT <br />
          A GLANCE
        </h3>
        <p>
          Dunfermline is a historic town in Scotland, located in the county of
          Fife. Once the countryâ€™s capital, it is known for its rich medieval
          heritage, including Dunfermline Abbey, the burial site of King Robert
          the Bruce. The town also played a key role during the Industrial
          Revolution and is the birthplace of Andrew Carnegie, the famous
          Scottish philanthropist. Today, Dunfermline is a vibrant town that
          blends history, culture, and green spaces, such as Pittencrieff Park.
